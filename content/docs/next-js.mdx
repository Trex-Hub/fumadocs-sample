Below, you will find examples of headings, text formatting, lists, links, images, code, tables, blockquotes, and horizontal rules.

## Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, from H1 to H6. Here are examples of each:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Text Formatting

You can emphasize text using bold, italic, and strikethrough formatting:

- **Bold text**: Use double asterisks or underscores (`**text**` or `__text__`).
- _Italic text_: Use single asterisks or underscores (`*text*` or `_text_`).
- ~~Strikethrough text~~: Use double tildes (`~~text~~`).

## Lists

Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists, as well as nested lists for hierarchical content.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Nested List

- Parent item
  - Child item 1
  - Child item 2
    - Grandchild item

## Links

Add clickable links to external or internal resources:

- [External link to Google](https://www.google.com): Links to an external website.

## Images

Embed images with optional alt text for accessibility:

Image support is there but not working as expected.

## Code

Showcase code snippets using inline code or fenced code blocks.

- Inline code: Use backticks to write `console.log('Hello, world!');`.
- Fenced code block: Use triple backticks with an optional language identifier for syntax highlighting.

### JavaScript
```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
    ```

### Python
```python
def greet():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

### Rust
```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Tables

| ------------- | --- | ----------------- |
| John Doe      | 30  | Software Engineer |
| Jane Smith    | 25  | Data Scientist    |
| Alice Johnson | 35  | Designer          |
